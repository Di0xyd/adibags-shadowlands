# AdiBags Creator (by Zottelchen)

**What does it do?**

It takes item ids from lists in /items and creates an AdiBags Plugin from that. Just put your Blizzard API credentials into system variables BLIZZ_ID and BLIZZ_SECRET and run create.py. 

The idlists may contain some special symbols:

* \# - defines a comment for the generated Markdown file
* ! - defines a description for the AdiBags filter
* $ - defines a hex color for the AdiBags category
